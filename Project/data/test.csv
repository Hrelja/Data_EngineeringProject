28627, customary disclaimer about how patriotic indian concerned about the state affairs country the recent exchanges between the indian and the pakistani armed forces and how the governments both countries have used certain narratives highly troublesome opinion after the pulwama attack india claimed that iaf attacked jem camp and called preemptive attack simultaneously amit shah going around the country election campaigns and citing revenge and teach lesson his speeches asking for votes these are very contradicting outlooks and while all being lapped engaged and enraged audience puts serious question marks the integrity the current government pakistan the other hand has said suffered damages the iaf attack there are stories air raid site casualties mysterious madrassa 190227183058957 html going around where claimed that the iaf just destroyed some trees since then they have also circulated videos indian pilot captivity and mostly the rhetoric has been how being treated with respect and care now coming what really concerns that the citizens both countries are failing see through the political narratives already embarrassing for india that while delayed accepting any indian pilot being captured there were videos circulating online proving biggest fear right now that more proof comes forward the iaf strike not achieving much further questions are asked will become ego issue for modi inch chest and will see more retaliation and this retaliation mind you will not have much effect the kashmir issue terrorism but will pandering voter base pakistanis the other hand the light these skirmishes have completely forgotten that fairly established fact today that their government and military have created environment where harbouring terrorists and denying the same the norm and the pakistani government and military shifting the spotlight from that onto exchanges with india and how unfair india its assessments writing this post with appeal for citizens both countries see beyond political agendas and realise that war even these skirmishes are very dangerous for two countries which should basically focussing growth want encourage debate how make citizens more aware and how not fall for politically motivated narratives and ofcourse heavily biased media both sides not helping the cause will for sure get some flak for questioning the veracity the iaf attacks the jem camp but find worthy questioning don think today day and age with widespread access internet nothing destroyed camp and almost 300 dead terrorists has leaked onto the internet even pakistan whole country collectively tried hide that news would prove quite difficult but hope most redditers can move beyond that and understand the real concern behind questioning that ,1

shah wali allah regarded the british presence the subcontinent well what perceived threat posed the dormant hindu majority serious danger his
community saw the political decline muslims the subcontinent prelude total religious disintegration his fears were further accentuated the misunderstanding and some instances ignorance islam his community mainly result centuries long interaction with the hindu community well the recent contact with western
thought
hence shah wali allah was convinced that unless muslims went back their religion order face the challenge hinduism permanent decadence the muslim community india would undoubtedly ensue his opinion muslims india had preserve their
distinct identity being different from the rest the indian communities and particularly
the hindus order muslims should restrict their interaction with the latter else
islamic values would completely obliterated confirmed hafeez malik the below
statement while the hindu culture has always been assimilative and
willing synthesize with other religions islam had face the
problem preserving its distinct identity which closer cultural
relations with the hindu society would progressively erode shah wali allah uttered cry for islam danger the south asian subcontinent and muslim theologian felt duty bound something save his religion and religionists
from further disintegration thus and his followers embarked revivalist and
reformist campaign amongst the muslim community british india that encouraged
communal tendencies and attitudes common muslims only mainly religious thinking
towards that end urged his community return the islamic religion seek
salvation stated that only god can relied and muslims should stick god sacred
book namely the holy quran spear 224 225 fact staunchly believed that the holy quran was the one and only source that
provided guidance the right path well knowledge all humanity and that the real success for muslims the earthly life well after death parenthetically this stance shah walyi allah delhavi and his disciples vis vis non muslims and non sunnis reflects the rigidly sectarian character the approach their
revivalist movement mat ter fact many historians agree the fact that the leader this movement shah walyi allah delhavi was line with his contemporary mohammed
ibn abd wahhab one the most radical islamists who launched similar revivalist
movement the arabian peninsula historically known the wah habist movement the repudiation islamic aspects islam led shah waliy allah delhavi and his followers embark process islamisition the muslim society the indian subcontinent towards this end urged his religionists adhere the cultural values the muslim
world which were accepted and exemplified the prophet mohammed his sunna malik
1980 257 matter fact ing arab origin shah waliy allah delhavi called
upon his community keep aloof from the cultural mainstream the indian subcontinent
and not neglect the customs and mores the early arabs because they were the
immediate followers the prophet mohammed malik 1980 257 moreover for him was necessary that muslims should cease regard themselves part the general indian society and should never forget that they were integral part the
larger muslim world karandi kar 1968 127 this respect upadhyay 2003 quotes
the indian historian istiaq hussain qureshi saying that shah walyi allah delhavi did not want the muslims become part the general milieu the sub continent wanted them keep alive their relation with the rest the muslim world that the spring their inspiration and ideals might ever remain located islam and tradition world commu nity developed physical and geographical contiguity” integral part the people india and think themselves “natural part the muslim world eventually this would the eyes shah wali allah critics prevent the growth any feeling national unity between indian
muslims and the other communities inhabiting the same country india indeed shah wali
allah incurred wave opprobrium and condemnation from many twentieth century indian
scholars and and prominent leaders the indian nationalist movement mainly those who
adopted western nationalism ideology was accused having sowed the seeds disunity among the inhabitants the indian subcontinent which made difficult their
struggle for freedom from the yoke british colonialism
for instance undertone regret banerjee stated that shah wali allah separatist tendency resulted the fact that “although they—indian muslims—were india they would not india” banerjee the meantime upadhyay
confirms this point stating that shah wali allah “emphasis arabization indian islam did not allow the emotional integration indian muslims with the
rest the population this country ” added regressively affecting the muslim
psyche his ideology debarred from forward looking vision” upadhyay 2003 another
article upadhyay declared that “the religio political ideology wali ullah made permanent crack hindu muslim relation this sub continent which undermined the self pride and dignity integrated indian society”
shah wali allah and his like minded muslim fellows were preaching among their community
was nothing more than different form nationalism whereby they aimed the
cultivation feeling belonging larger group people indeed appealing coreligionists join the worldwide muslim community their objective was create rather extend the already existing muslim nation called “ummah” ",1

4102,the problem with these insane auction revenue that the money eventually comes out our pockets basically the government taking huge loan with emis and forcing the people pay back both principal and interest some private company that they have control over the low cost the licenses helped boost mobile penetration across the country from million 2004 375 million 2008 670 million 2012 the lowered cost calls from increased competition allowed poorer sections get connected despite the rupee plunging from inr 2008 inr 2012 ever since the licenses were cancelled the cost voice calls has gone multiple times spectrum was auctioned the highest bidder years ago and were supposed have 150 million subscribers 2014 but all managed was measly million and coverage concentrated the cities and most rural areas don even have the option using even they are willing pay for but all the money from the bwa auctions ended being spent schemes like fsb aaadhar subsidising loss making psus like air india bsnl etc windfall auctions are never good for the consumers large because thanks the huge amounts invested upfront which are usually bank loans taken the companies they try recover much money possible the earliest and that means higher prices for everyone until they start making profits the same thing happened with auctions europe where telcos bid massive amounts the auctions and then failed roll out networks and went begging the govt change the license terms and allow the operators share networks etc meet coverage goals these coal auctions are worse because the central govt allocates the coal blocks and all the money goes the states which may may not have actual use for the money instead coming viable development schemes that get funding from japan etc now the states will able spend all this money any hare brained scheme that the party power can choose promote and unlike spectrum where both the businesses and the end consumers are located the same area coal consumers are not necessarily located the state that producing them people other parts the country end pumping money coffers the coal producing states governments and will not even see the benefits the 15lakh crores that going collected from them edit here opinion piece pointing out other flaws the system the auctions 115021601818 html edit2 not defending upa practice handing out spectrum coal mines their friends just pointing out the flaws going with the highest bidder shows shortsightedness the part the government short term good for the govts the day may lead long term pains and losses for the country large more other reply ,1

28061, just shut and follow ikeda “that the way practice correctly” shintaro ishihara diet member grandson died truly would have been alright hadn but buddhist punishment for slandering ishihara thought was fool despised and tried make fool anyone who meets gains fortune anyone who betrays antagonizes will fall into hell this the severe law buddhism remember that well all ikeda own words nichiren’ “standard proof” “doesn’ apply daisaku” “ the sensei” leader permitted acquire following his own for would divisive incursion into president ikeda prerogatives supreme leader source forget about raising successors and the next generation ends with ikeda whatever and the say and print are true “that mindset must cease” this something that work toward here the ikeda worship which ikeda himself promotes truly disgusting gotten infinitely worse since the nichiren shoshu priesthood excommunicated ikeda and removed his dumb cult from their list approved lay organizations take look daisaku ikeda the world’ foremost authority nichiren buddhism source that what found over one the sgi many vanity presses paid for the sgi members donations which exists only publish things written others that daisaku ikeda name rubber stamped can pretend author all the cult leaders self publish via their own culty little vanity presses why should daisaku ikeda considered the world foremost authority nichiren buddhism never completed any formal course study never been tonsured has credentials whatsoever even people the real world don consider him legitimate scholar examination soka education necessitates reiterating its virtual unfamiliarity academic and educational circles outside japan therefore any critical analysis soka comes with the proviso that great deal what has been written about this approach its principal proponents currently inaccessible for broad based study the chief reasons for this are twofold firstly neither makiguchi toda nor ikeda are regarded scholars any traditional sense they were not university educated formally trained academics and therefore their essentially makiguchi’ and toda’ publications were largely relegated relative obscurity japanese educational spheres source 2016 1138575 credentials matter outside cult leader little cult personality there are plenty priests nichiren priests who have been studying everything nichiren and lotus sutra since their teens who have devoted their entire careers and lifetimes the study these teachings while daisaku ikeda has instead chosen jet setting lifestyle paying various people meet with him sit for photo that will then played like was some big deal daisaku ikeda has never shakubukued single person even apparently simply being the top authoritarian the soka gakkai organizations makes him default the world foremost authority the three top theoreticians the gakkai the supreme theoretician course president ikeda followed probably kodaira yoshihei toda convert member parliament general administrator and the head the study department supreme theoretician simply the prerogative the topmost authoritarian the dictatorship pyramid sure sounds like that the award you win for seizing the presidency hmm little could anyone have ever imagined that when ikeda was born would mentor leader peace activist and truly one the greatest humans that has ever lived source one the greatest humans that has ever lived wowzers who said humility and modesty had any place within true buddhism remember ikeda permitting this sort grotesque hero worship not outright designing everyone sgi should embarrassed this naked preening and self glorification why should ikeda considered the supreme theoretician anyone can say that where the actual proof where the evidence that ikeda does fact possess the requisite qualifications where are ikeda credentials what legitimate study program has ikeda completed dropped out community college his very first semester ikeda has nothing and yet the sgi members are supposed believe that this greedy grasping little man who has only ever sought power and wealth somehow more knowledgeable than the priests who devoted themselves study and practice for entire careers and even lifetimes obscene scandal this not buddhism this one hopelessly insecure little man quest for immortality ikeda bound for oblivion just surely any other person who has ever existed eternity will not remember his name anyone source and what about actual proof ikeda favorite son died age stomach ailment that rarely fatal for all his efforts ikeda has failed awarded the nobel peace prize all ikeda jibbajabba about making the impossible possible sure looks like empty words doesn ikeda can make work when has the luxury devoting every moment every day what chance you have making work and what about world peace than when toda recreated the soka gakkai after wwii things have been getting better anywhere the world thanks the ikeda cult ikeda and his dumb cult are useless all this worship daisaku ikeda isn doing anyone bit good except for daisaku ikeda course how demeaning being nothing more than chorus member sing the praises one self important little swine man that all the sgi members exist for what about ikeda life worth emulating has friends hasn been able shakubuku single person everybody japan hates him doesn even have any grandchildren his own family completely broken ikeda nothing but vampire who thinks can suck away everyone else life force and money and thus live forever ,1

handpicked trusted bureaucrat little known outside india’ financial circles spearhead radical move abolish percent the country’ cash overnight and take aim the huge shadow economy hasmukh adhia the bureaucrat and five others privy the plan were sworn utmost secrecy say sources with knowledge the matter they were supported young team researchers working two rooms modi’ new delhi residence plotted his boldest reform since coming power 2014 when announced the abolition high value banknotes 500 and 000 rupees and came bolt from the blue the secrecy was aimed outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge pouring cash into gold property and other assets and hide illicit wealth previously unreported details modi’ handling the called “demonetisation” open window onto the hands role played implementing key policy and how was willing act quickly even when the risks were high while some advocates say the scrapping the banknotes will bring more money into the banking system and raise tax revenues millions indians are furious having queue for hours outside banks exchange deposit their old money labourers have also been unpaid and produce has rotted markets cash stopped changing hands not enough replacement notes were printed preparation for the upheaval and could take months for things return normal with india’ most populous state uttar pradesh holding election early 2017 that could decide modi’ chances second term office there little time for the hoped for benefits his cash swap outweigh short term pain modi has staked his reputation and popularity the move “ have done all the research and fails then blame ” modi told cabinet meeting nov shortly before the move was announced according three ministers who attended direct line modi overseeing the campaign with support from the backroom team camped out modi’ sprawling bungalow the capital was adhia top finance ministry official the year old served principal secretary modi from 2003 when was chief minister gujarat state establishing relationship trust with his boss and introducing him yoga colleagues interviewed reuters said had reputation for integrity and discretion adhia was named revenue secretary sept 2015 reporting formally finance minister arun jaitley reality had direct line modi and they would speak their native gujarati when they met discuss issues depth the world’ largest democracy the demonetisation was revolutionary called into question the state’ promise “pay the bearer” the face value every banknote stroke modi scrapped money worth trillion rupees billion equal percent cash asia’ third largest economy the idea backed some economists although the speed its implementation widely seen radical “one never ready for this kind disruption – but constructive disruption ” said narendra jadhav year veteran and former chief economist india’ central bank who now represents modi’ party the upper house parliament modi his address the nation cautioned that people could face temporary hardship replacement 500 and 000 rupee notes were introduced calling for act collective sacrifice promised steps soften the blow for the nine indians who live the cash economy “biggest boldest step” immediately after the address adhia sent tweet “this the biggest and the boldest step the government for containing black money ” the boast harked back modi’ election vow recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed with the corruption scandals that plagued the last congress government yet office struggled keep his promise over more than year modi commissioned research from officials the finance ministry the central bank and think tanks how advance his fight against black money close aide said demanded answers questions such how quickly india could print new banknotes how distribute them would state banks benefit they received rush new deposits and who would gain from demonetisation the topics were broken prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that cash swap was the offing “ didn’ want let the cat out the bag ” said senior official directly involved “had people got whiff the decision the whole exercise would have been meaningless ” under adhia’ oversight the team researchers assembled and modeled the findings what was for theoretical exercise was made young experts data and financial analysis some ran modi’ social media accounts and smartphone app that used solicit public feedback yet for all the planning modi and adhia knew they could not foresee every eventuality and were willing move swiftly the announcement caused chaos with huge queues forming banks when they reopened after short holiday new 000 rupee notes were hard come and barely any new 500 rupee notes had been printed india’ 200 000 cash dispensers could not handle the new smaller notes and would take weeks reconfigure them filling atms with the trillion rupees billion new banknotes that the finance ministry reckons are needed restore liquidity the economy even trickier best case scenario which india’ four banknote presses churned out new 500 and 000 rupee notes designed replace the abolished ones would take least three months hit that target secrecy paramount secrecy was paramount but clues had been left back april analysts state bank india said that demonetisation large denomination notes was possible the reserve bank india the central bank also disclosed may that was making preparations for new series banknotes that were confirmed august when announced had approved design for new 000 rupee note the printing presses had only just started turning when the media finally started run with the story late october “the plan was introduce around nov but there was clear sign that could get leaked ” said one person with direct knowledge who like others interviewed reuters asked not named due the sensitivity the matter some officials the finance ministry had expressed doubts about scrapping high value notes when the idea came for discussion they now feel resentment the secrecy which adhia rammed through the plan modi’ orders they also say the plan was flawed because failure ramp printing new notes ahead time

against the military occupation indian troops responded with bullets and more recently with pellet guns completely partially blinding hundreds protesters india and pakistan blame each other each country obsessed with proving itself better than the other but they share the responsibility for reducing kashmir ruin and destroying generations kashmiri lives the past several years the phrase often recall when think home “dying invisibly ones and twos ” every death another knife into bloodied body have been thinking about all this quite bit over the past two weeks feb suicide attack convoy

hailed the strikes wickedly obtuse language “pre emptive nonmilitary strikes” and the giddily compliant news media were told official sources that more than 300 militants had been killed security analysts india credited the airstrikes with destroying the illusion that nuclear deterrence can keep india from hitting terrorist infrastructure inside pakistan but modi’ plan didn’ intended independent reporting showed that the indian jets had hit some trees field — and not much else the next morning pakistani fighter jets dropped some bombs inside indian controlled territory which did damage restored pakistan’ national pride and showed its willingness escalate beyond indian expectations dogfight between pakistani and indian jets ensued indian plane was shot down pakistani territory

29228, been closely following the news the claims the debunking claims etc and think that have theory what exactly happened the air engagement that let the indian pilot capture first all though you need bear mind that war government military including india and pakistan always speaks 100 truthfully for different reasons they actually believe that what they are saying correct the time that they said this especially true air air combat where every war history all sides claim have shot down more planes than were actually shot down air combat can confusing due the speeds and distances involved they are trying protect military operational secrets tell lies publically order maintain military secret good example this was the 1991 gulf war where the and saudi kept claiming that almost all the iraqi scud missiles were successfully intercepted patriot missiles order get iraq stop trying fire the missiles the reality was that the patriots only hit minority incoming missiles they know that don know the truth for sure but with whatever information they have that information helps with the morale their own fighting forces and civilians this why for example ww2 many pilots would get credit the kills they claimed even when solid proof was missing with that said what know about the aerial engagement pakistan said that indian planes chasing its retaliatory strike entered pakistani space initially pakistan claimed planes were shot down one pilot custody and one hospital pakistan later officially changed that one plane mig and one pilot india agreed that they chased the strike said immediately that they were chasing 16s and claimed have shot down one them pakistan denied using 16s the operation said was 17s india then days later claimed they had electronic signatures data indicating 16s were involved and then produced wreckage from amraam aim 120 missile saying that 16s are the only planes south asia than can fire that missile now lets look the actual evidence mig shot down solid proof photos and video the wreck and pilot evidence 2nd indian plane shot down evidence but pakistan officially stopped claiming this shot down evidence all the photo evidence india claimed has now been proven false third party experts 16s involved the aim 120 wreckage pretty damning initial claims that was sold taiwan have been denied taiwan and based experts have said that the overall sale package that include the missile covered both taiwan and pakistan the missile likely have been sold pakistan however the aim 120 long range missile over 100km mile range and not missile that pakistan would use close range encounter like the one that india claimed occured india said they fired heat seeking missiles which has 30km mile range the amraam very unlikely have been fired from the information saying that the could fire them very old from around 2008 and all recent information says that they only fire the chinese version the missile instead amraam could not fired from plane with chinese radar like the does missiles are compatible only with the radar systems they were built for how you reconcile all this theory which fits the available evidence below pakistan had plan retaliate dropping bombs indian kashmir mission profile 17s strike element crossing into indian airspace 16s were used long distance escort using long range aim 120 missiles from safely deep inside pakistani airspace 17s dropped bombs just before the indian migs were interception range they turned round and burned hard for pakistani space the mig 21s chased them hard and are faster than 17s almost catching them before hitting the border the indian wing commander made the call hot pursuit that brought them range fire missiles 17s used flares evade the missiles but since the missiles still detonated close enough the pakistani planes that looked like kill the indian pilots the from distance looks lot like and could visually confused more this later but the same time once the indians were pakistani space the 16s range fired least one amraam taking out mig either wreckage from that missiles was carried into india inertia more likely second amraam missed its target perhaps because the second mig was diving away while using countermeasures and ended india why pakistan initially though got planes kill and then one missile fired resulting the target rapidly losing altitude and why india thought got kill also explains why the amraam part ended india and explains why pakistani denied the use 16s not trying give away that they use long range amraam missiles cover the escape strike planes the indian plane that got away would have brought with electronic data showing that was getting painted the kind radar that the carries this together with the easy confuse misidentification the with would have led india convinced that they were only fighting 16s and not 17s like they actually were for the issue why pakistan initially claimed one pilot custody and one hospital that simple ispr the time had pieces information work into immediate press release the time pakistan claimed have shot down planes indian pilot was reported have been taken into custody indian pilot was hospital getting treated the time ispr had make statement was not clear them that the indian pilot taken into custody was then taken hospital and was thus the same pilot they reported hospital since they thought there were different indian pilots that fitted well with the claims they had the time planes being shot down ,1

33300, 2002 narendra modi the current india and then rss hardliner mismanaged riot and turned into state sponsored pogrom gave the rioters free hand and several his mlas and ministers were convicted rioting instigating the riots and giving the rioters list muslim owned houses was investigated special investigation team sit report exonerates modi the highlights 473243 html appointed the supreme court india under congress government and cleared all guilt another court later upheld this verdict one major reason lost was the fact that was deemed too moderate and ‘anti hindu’ while this probably some the reason lost should mentioned here that the results were total surprise everyone and contradicted the polls quite bit one the hindu right going vote for congress and turnout was still somewhat high though modi had campaigned these things and tried more moderate and economic focused the first few years lost track far all the major policies under him have either been economic foreign policy related the only major social policies under him have been letting the court making rulings social policy without interference homosexuality triple talaq and repealing the hajj subsidy due rise right wing nationalism there were multiple lynchings muslims which modi was silent the cow lynchings part absolutely true they have risen since got elected however modi has condemned lynchings indias modi condemns violence name cow worship iduskbn19k13s though criticizing him the speed his response valid point fake news say hasn condemned the government also demonetized the economy late 2016 win elections don think was win and haven really heard that until now the government claims have done for variety reasons overall the effects seem the government has failed its objective make harder launder money demonetization caused significant dip gdp growth the objective reduce terrorism was achieved naxalite communist terrorists were forced surrender masse some areas though whether this trend has sustained debated addition tax collection increased and continuing the increase the party currently using terrorist attacks for political gains they responded terror attack likely backed pakistan attacking terrorists they have done this twice the first which confirmed video while the second which contested idea how striking back can construed some sort exploitation event congress party has some nutty policies they barely have policies the bjp stands for something while the congress stands for getting the congress power the party has been ruled historically corrupt political dynasty for bit now and functions making populist promises well appealing certain demographics usually their winning coalition consists minority religions which why they blocked shah bano certain castes hindus and any farmers they can win over they usually will propose some sort pro farmer policies right now they playing the role opposition party fairly well but almost too well they just contradicted everything the bjp has said without offering too much platform past pure populism there couple people who are actual true heart congress believers but for most people matter substance and some corruption better worse than hindu nationalism these parties want wreck the indian economy and are supported ‘economists’ from leftist indian universities while this absolutely true throw the commies bone here like the bjp and unlike the congress they actually stand for something and are fairly noncorrupt they been ruling the state kerala for while now and the state has some really really good indicators good fact one the few examples communists can point when asked about the success communism don really have responses past this point just expressing thoughts individual parties tmc this one more just ranting than actual response mamata herself congress the extreme while congress this election has been adopting soft hindutva which basically translates visiting temples mamata has like said been accused various anti hindu things not mention outright forbidding processions for fairly important hindu holiday allow muslim holiday continue without fear violence bahujan samaj party takes advantage casteist feelings the extreme indian politics identity politics the bjp tries make blocs vote religion and congress does caste whoever wins the lower caste hindu like india white working class swing vote vote wins the election bsp caste based politics turned party for low castes precipitated giving low castes more power for those you who don know india has what republicans think affirmative action the states namely they reserve certain number seats colleges and government jobs for minorities and more importantly historically underpriviledged castes now you get situations where historically privileged castes vote blocs get reservation status and certain castes are thrown under the bus they were historically priv but don have enough numbers significant voting bloc and ofc mayawatis solution give upper castes cms reservation too ncp ncp the nationalist congress party like the congress ncp also social democratic but also appeals indian civic nationalism the party opposed sonia gandhi being congress leader the party opposes indian citizens ‘unnatural’ origins from holding public offices that why was created sonia longer leader and they just usually form coalition with congress they probably close the center but still secular shiv sena you hit this one pretty much right the nail also like say the gujurat riots the one modi was blamed for prompted the leader the shiv sena call muslims cancer aam admi party along with bjp congress and left this the only party with national name recognition lol they literally confined delhi and like other states where they have legislative presence basically delhi aap just talked lot about because indian liberals love and the idea also the left doesn have ton real presence either they have about seats the lok sabha combined tdp this one fairly accurate and pretty sad honest the direction the party pretty free floating andhra needs some development after losing hyderabad aimim– aimim the islamic equivalent the bjp seeks establish islamic democracy india and often resorts hate based rhetoric like advocating genocide more like the islamic equivalent the shiv sena also they only somewhat relevant their

8629,brilliant point point breakdown one other argument making the rounds false argument okay maybe the strikes took place but should have been kept secret and deniable there good reason for dgmo make statements about covert actions except for bjp score political points there are massive number reasons make strike like this public exposes pakistan bluster just tough talk for all their talk being high alert for indian troop movement along the loc after the uri attack they didn even see coming massively boosts morale within the armed forces morale which has been getting steadily lower our bases kept getting hit while they were not allowed take charge the offensive the troops are also being vilified the media national and international while trying control spiral violence srinagar fueled pakistan propaganda machine makes the best use pakistan blunder overreaching and outmaneuvers them pakistan has its hands tied now after making bold statements about defending against indian adventurism aggression and denying that any terrorist camps even exist the region that they have the support their government pakistan has left itself publicly admissible out can either promise retaliation for strikes thereby confirming the existence such terror bases deny the strike and claim ignorance any bases the area releasing statements and evidence the strikes india makes pakistan look weak and incompetent defense while also making the point that pakistan harbors terrorists and uses them proxy war against india manner that exceeds just providing moral and diplomatic support they have claimed the past calls pakistan bluff threats start nuclear conflict their nuclear arsenal while still being very real and implicit threat longer their impenetrable shield striking within pok and then making public india has taken control the escalatory ladden you said earlier out the open for everyone see which leads the next point makes public the strategic shift indian policy dealing with cross border infiltration and terrorism this now means that india controls the play events and that infiltration will actively fought against taking the fight the terror outposts and leaving open the possibility even striking training camps situated further inland this means that india will make pakistan work and pay for every infiltration attempt literally not just pay terms revenge and bloodshed pakistan will need actually spend more time money resources manpower actual defense and surveillance near these bases their terror outposts will have constantly vigilant and more resources dedicated keeping eye out for incoming strikes the future this very different from the past where the outposts had nothing worry about till they crossed the border and their entire focus was offensive not defensive nature points out very little fencing the pakistani side because they never even felt the need defend themselves but that will all change now terrorists will not sleep peacefully their beds they will possibly make more mistakes and every new person recruited keep watch patrol their perimeter potential vulnerability too accidentally leaked info paid informant mole many these will make increasingly expensive and difficult maintain multiple such bases leading demoralized terrorists demoralized pakistani troops demoralized and disillusioned pakistani public pakistan currently damage control mode firing off more propaganda than artillery and trying pooh pooh the stories the strikes indian propaganda but inaccuracies their accounts will begin add and morale will definitely take hit everyone the pakistani side currently denial but that expected ultimately again makes the government look dishonest incompetent and erodes their imaginary moral high ground that they lay claim strengthens the indian public support for the government this definitely well deserved win for the bjp but more importantly makes the indian public lot more unified behind their central government regardless who was power when such action was taken there are certainly plenty who question the narrative and events but there definite surge public approval favor retaliation for uri and the strikes themselves regardless their position the who how where why covert overt bragging courting war etc this demonstrates among other things that the goi proactive that was receptive the outrage about uri across the nation that was willing take stand such attacks indian sovereignty demonstrates india ability operate within the bounds previous agreements and treaties while still taking decisive action defend itself and not being enslaved those treaties pakistan has always played victim when came any border related issue and deny any involvement previous incursions from their side meanwhile india hamstrung restrictive treaties preventing military retaliation for numerous actions carried out pakistan and its proxy fighters till now this deft navigation not altering the loc while striking terrorist camps falls well within the bounds the simla agreement and the charter surgical strikes across loc line with shimla agreement and charter 3026586 html exploring this avenue publicly means that india can now freely continue perform such strikes the future without invoking any backlash from most other nations and getting active support from several now let assume that the strikes took place but the government kept absolutely secret the outcome not making the strikes public knowledge would have been quite disadvantageous the whole india maintains deniability for aggressive action great but pakistan will constantly play the victim anyway portray cross border terrorism domestic rebellion foment unrest and paint india oppressive bully state committing atrocities kashmir very little advantage here while the strike killed handful terrorists and prevented few attacks the near future would fail adequately capitalize that victory other terror outfits and individual members such organisations may remain unaware and unafraid pakistani turf terrorists sleeping soundly before attempting border crossing isn good for indian defense maintaining state combat ready vigilance and tension impossible for more than few days for all but the most highly trained soldiers demoralizes indian troops they would feel abandoned the govt and the people left deal with bloodthirsty militants all themselves without any chance take action and preempt such attacks the indian soldiers continue the only ones who sleep fear with the fatigue constant vigilance making them weaker while the enemy gets stronger indian silence taken for weakness emboldens our enemies india seen soft target home and abroad india loses control the narrative the few who would aware the covert action the other side could later alter the narrative they have done several times the past and claim india committed atrocities and crimes pakistani territory and killed civilians blaming raw and other agencies and using justify further attacks several years the future the context and events this time would have faded from the public mind and india would the diplomatic back foot having either deny the action ever took place and look guilty forced justify such action and remind the public that was retaliation for uri not random unprovoked attack better claim upfront and connect the two events inextricably forever india retaliates for uri massacre today lot better than india denies committing war crimes pok years later when the conspiracy theorists would have had plenty time concoct alternate narrative pakistan would continue have the facade nuclear shield despite successful strike until challenged head publicly pakistan claims would continue hold weight pakistan retains control the escalatory ladder pakistan bluff not called and continues project the image competent military pakistan retains the facade harboring terrorists its soil what terrorists public acknowledgement shift the policy strategic restraint indian public loses faith the government not knowing about any retaliation would mean that the indian public would just have another item list complain about how the government all talk action critics the government perceived restraint would continue make the government look weak and ineffective bjp would crucified the public eye for not taking stronger measures because the public wouldn know about the strike the voice the people would appear have been ignored future governments would unlikely continue the shift strategy reluctance take control the offensive would persist continued veil secrecy would mean that their efforts would unnoticed while the costs and risks such operations would for little political benefit ,1
